	\textbf{Failure factors of the C-Net}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{It was proprietary, a closed system}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The closed system caused a monopoly for infrastructure and handsets
			\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{It was expensive}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Lack of competition in Germany
				\item This also prevented prices from falling
				\item If amount of users reaches capacity limits, prices were raised
				\item In contrast: NMT fixed their technology to cope the demand
			\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Only few attracted users}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Missing positive externalities
			\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{The lack of leadership}
			 \begin{itemize}
				 \item Neither government nor companies formed a committee
			 \end{itemize}
